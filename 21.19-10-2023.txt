Angular
-------

CanDeactivate
-------------
    --> You can use the CanDeactivate guard to prevent users from accidentally leaving a route/page in your application. 
    --> For example if such page contains a text editor with unsaved changes or an unsubmitted form.

Animation
---------
    --> The animate() function accepts the timings and styles input parameters. 

Pagination
----------
    --> Pagination is used to split a large set of data into a sequence of pages that have similar content. 

Hosting Angular project
-----------------------

Step 1:
-------
    --> Create your Github Repository:
    --> After creating the repo, commit all your changes and push your project files to the repository you have created.

Step 2:
-------
    --> Install Angular CLI gh-pages:
    --> $ npm i angular-cli-ghpages --save-dev

Step 3:
-------
    Run Build :
    ---------
            --> $ ng build --prod --base-href "https://GithubUserName.github.io/GithubRepoName/"
            --> Note: Make sure you put in your Github username in “GithubUserName” and the repository name you created in “GithubRepoName” sections of the URL.

Step 4:
-------
    Deploy to gh-pages:
    -------------------
            --> $ npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/Project-name
            --> Note: Make sure you put the name of the project in the place of “Project-name” in the command above.

Step 6:
-------
    Visit the App Page:
    ------------------
            --> Visit the URL to your App gh-pages, 
            --> It is the same URL you created earlier on our terminal; https://GithubUserName.github.io/GithubRepoName/
