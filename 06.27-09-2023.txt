In javascript I have learned basic like variables,keyword,condition,loops, and slight move on advanced topic.
Instead of using normal function we use arrow function.
For iterate an array use for of loop.
fFor iterate an object use for in loop.
and we learned map,spread,filter,reduce,slice,AsynAwait in depth.
