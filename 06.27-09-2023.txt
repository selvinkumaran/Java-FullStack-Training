In javascript I have learned basic:
                    --> Variables
                    --> Keyword
                    --> Condition
                    --> Loops

And slight move on advanced topic.
        --> Instead of using normal function we use arrow function.
        --> For iterate an array use for of loop.
        --> For iterate an object use for in loop.
        --> Map,Spread,filter,reduce,slice,AsynAwait in depth.
