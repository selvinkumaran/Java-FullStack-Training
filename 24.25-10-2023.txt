Java Concepts
-------------

Thread:
-------
    Two ways to create a thread 
        --> * To extend thread class
        --> * To implement Runnable interface

Exception
---------
    --> * Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors

Types
-----
    --> * Checked Exception
    --> * Unchecked Exception
    --> * Error


try
---
    --> * The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code
    --> * It means we can't use try block alone
    --> * The try block must be followed by either catch or finally

catch
-----
    --> * The "catch" block is used to handle the exception
    --> * It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone
    --> * It can be followed by finally block later.
    --> * finally	The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program
    --> * It is executed whether an exception is handled or not

throw
-----
    --> * The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception

throws
------
    --> * The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions
    --> * It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method.
    --> * It doesn't throw an exception
    --> * It is always used with method signature.

Custom Exception
----------------

package H_Exception;

// A Class that represents use-defined exception

class MyException extends Exception {
}

public class SimpleException {

    // A Class that uses above MyException
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        try {
            // Throw an object of user defined exception
            throw new MyException();
        } catch (MyException ex) {
            System.out.println("Caught");
        }
    }
}


File Handling
-------------
    --> * File Reader
    --> * Buffer Reader

Unit Testing
-----------
    --> * @BeforeAll 
    --> * @BeforeEach
    --> * @Test
    --> * @DisplayName
    --> * @AfterEach
    --> * @AfterAll
