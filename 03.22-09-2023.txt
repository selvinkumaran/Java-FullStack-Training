I have created a CIBC website using:
                                 --> HTML 5  
                                 --> CSS 3

And I learned to host a site in github.

Makes some changes after commit and push a cod in github.


Original website:
----------------
        --> https://www.cibc.com/en/personal-banking.html

Website:
-------
        --> https://selvinkumaran.github.io/CIBC/
